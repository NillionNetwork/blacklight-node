nilUV nodes help secure nilCC (Nillion's Confidential Compute layer). Once running, they are continuously assigned work to verify the attestations of live running workloads, running on nilCC, are valid and correct.

## Overview

nilUV is a decentralized verification network where nodes verify HTX transactions emitted by nilCC operators. The system uses a smart contract to coordinate node registration, HTX assignment, and verification results.

**How it works:**
1. **nilCC operators** submit HTXs to the `NilUVRouter` smart contract, which include information about the workload that is being ran.
2. **Smart Contract** randomly assigns HTXs to registered nilUV nodes.
3. **niluv Nodes** listen to HTX assignment events, verify them and submit the verification result back to the `NilUVRouter` contract. The verification process involves:
    a. Fetching the attestation report generated by the workload running in nilCC.
    b. Ensuring the attestation report is valid, meaning it's signed by an AMD certificate chain, and contains the expected measurement hash.
    c. Ensuring the measurement hash is included in the builder's trusted measurement hash index.

## How to run a node

Follow these steps to run your own nilUV verification node on the network.


### Prerequisites

1. Install [docker](https://www.docker.com/).
2. Pull the latest nilUV node image.
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/nillionnetwork/niluv/niluv_node:latest
   ```

### Setup & Run

1. Run the node for initial setup:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm -v ./:/app/ ghcr.io/nillionnetwork/niluv/niluv_node:latest
   ```

   On first run, the node will:
   - Generate a new wallet and save it to `./niluv_node.env`. **This file contains the node wallets's private key and 
   should be backed up**.
   - Display your wallet address and balances.
   - Stop and prompt you to fund your wallet with ETH and stake TEST tokens.

2. Continue to [wallet setup](#wallet-setup-all-options) below to fund your wallet and stake TEST tokens before running the node.

### Get ETH and TEST tokens

Ask someone to send you ETH Sepolia and TEST tokens to the address displayed by the node when starting.

### Start the node

After confirming your ETH balance and TEST token stake, start the nilUV node again:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v ./:/app/ ghcr.io/nillionnetwork/niluv/niluv_node:latest
```

This will make the nilUV node start processing HTX transactions, verifying them, and submitting results back to the contract.

For detailed logging, pass `-e RUST_LOG=DEBUG` as an extra parameter to docker, e.g.:

```bash
docker run -e RUST_LOG=DEBUG -it --rm -v ./:/app/ ghcr.io/nillionnetwork/niluv/niluv_node:latest
```
